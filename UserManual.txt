	This document explains the reasons behind designing the application in the way it was designed. It is categorized with respect to UserManual.txt, so for example section 1a in UserManual.txt talks about the login page, then (1ai, 1aii, 1aiii, etc.) in Architecture.txt refers to the login page as well.

	1ai. The reason why there is no signup button/link in the signin page is because this site is designed to be an admin only site. Where only admins can access the dashboard and manage the users
